### Ionic has really great documentation and a good community around it, so if you get stumped you'll be able to get help.

### Ionic uses Angular, so there's a lot of good docs around that as well.

### There isn't a whole lot needed to get started, <br />so you could have an app up and running very quickly.

### Ionic is built on Cordova, so you'll need have that installed.


### `npm install -g cordova ionic`
### `ionic start myApp tabs`
