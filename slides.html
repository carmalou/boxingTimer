My name is Carmen and I'm an ionic dev here in okc. In my spare time I am working on a project called TwisterJS, a series of apps to teach kids about tech. Check that out!

# What is Ionic?

---
class: center, middle

## Ionic is a JavaScript framework <br />utilizing Angular to create hybrid mobile apps.

---
class: center, middle

# Why would I use Ionic?

---
class: left, middle

### Ionic has really great documentation and a good community around it, so if you get stumped you'll be able to get help.

### Ionic uses Angular, so there's a lot of good docs around that as well.

### There isn't a whole lot needed to get started, <br />so you could have an app up and running very quickly.

# Pros and Cons

---
class: left, middle

### Pros to Ionic:

### • Single codebase for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone (with Ionic2)
### • Use a language/framework you already know to create apps
### • Create apps quickly

---
class: left, middle

### Cons to Ionic:

### • Not everything looks/feels the same across platforms
### • JavaScript can be slow on a device

# Ok, I'm in. Where do I start?

---
class: left, middle

### Once you've figured out what you want to make, you should head to Ionic's [getting started page](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/).

### This has a short three step walk-through to get Ionic running on your machine.

### There are also some starter apps you can download to get started which saves a lot on time.

# What do I need to run Ionic?

---
class: center, middle

### Ionic is built on Cordova, so you'll need have that installed.


### `npm install -g cordova ionic`
### `ionic start myApp tabs`

---
class: center, middle

# But that's it!

???
Ionic has angular included, so you don't need to worry about installing or requiring it. woo-hoo!

---
class: center, middle

# Optional extras

---
class: center, middle

# ng-cordova

---
class: left, middle

### ng-cordova is a library written on top of cordova.

### Cordova allows you to use and manipulate the hardware on the device, such as the camera, microphone, and speakers.

### ng-cordova wraps around the cordova functions and allows you to use them in angular.

???
I used an ng-cordova function to use the speakers to notify the user of rounds vs rests. I'll show you that here in a moment.

# Ionic Creator

---
class: left, middle

### Ionic Creator is a new tool from the devs at Ionic that makes rapid prototyping well...rapid.

### Creator allows you to drag and drop components within the browser to achieve a certain look and experiment, and then export the files with the components pre-filled.

???
Obviously this won't take care of any functionality for you, but if you need to build something quickly, creator is definitely worth checking out.

# I made a thing. Now what?

---

### `ionic serve`

### `ionic run <platform>`
